BindOn Mod â€“ Forge 1.20.1

The BindOn mod allows Minecraft servers to remotely simulate key presses on connected clients via commands.
For example, using /bindon f5 @a forces all players to switch their camera perspective.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Send simulated key presses (e.g. F1, F5, WASD) to any player via command

Supports function keys, movement keys, modifiers (Shift/Ctrl/Alt), and more

Designed for use in custom maps, cinematic sequences, and modpacks

ðŸ“œ Example Command:

/bindon f1 @p
This simulates the player pressing F1 (hides HUD).
